We've included a few helpful templates to get you started, which you can find nested in the `src/_includes/layouts` folder. By default Graph Origami uses a templating language called [Origami Templates](https://graphorigami.org/framework/templates.html), with files ending in `.ori`.

You can use front matter to pass data about the content of your pages and posts into the template, which builds it into the page.

- The basic page template is `page.ori`
- Each individual post uses `post.ori`
- The home and Posts pages use `postList.ori` to list all posts
