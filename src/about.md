# About this blog

I came to this pond in the woods because I wanted to live deliberately, to focus on the essential facts of life and see if I could learn what it had to teach me. I didn’t want to reach the end of my life only to realize that I hadn’t truly lived. Life is incredibly precious, and I didn’t want to spend it on things that don’t matter. I also didn’t want to just resign myself to a mundane existence unless it was absolutely necessary.

I wanted to live fully and deeply, to extract all the richness and meaning out of life, to live with purpose and intention, just like people long ago. My goal was to strip away all the junk, to cut a clear path and get to the core of what truly matters. I wanted to drive life into a corner, reduce it to its simplest form, and if it turned out to be harsh or difficult, then I wanted to face that head-on and share its truth with the world. But if it were something beautiful and sublime, I wanted to experience that fully and be able to share that experience as well.

This adventure is my way of discovering that truth. Thanks for being a part of this journey with me!
