# About this blog

I came to this pond in the woods because I want to live deliberately, to focus on the stuff that matters and see if I could learn what life had to teach me. I don't want to reach the end of my life only to realize that I haven't truly lived. Life is incredibly precious; I don't want to spend it on things that don’t matter.

I want to live fully and deeply, to get everything I can out of life, to live with purpose and intention like people did long ago. My goal is to strip away all the junk, to cut a clear path and get to the core of what truly matters. I want to drive life into a corner, reduce it to its simplest form — and if it turns out to be difficult, then I want to face that difficulty head-on and share that truth with the world. But if it is something beautiful and sublime, I want to experience that fully and be able to share that experience here on this blog as well.
