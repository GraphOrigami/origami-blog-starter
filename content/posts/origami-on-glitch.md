Congrats! You've launched a beautiful new Web Origami-powered blog on Glitch.

In the **README** you'll find an overview of the files that make up the project, and when you open the files in the editor you'll see comments explaining what's happening.

Your Web Origami blog contains three pages:

- Home–the intro page which also lists recent posts
- Posts–a list of all posts
- About–an overview of the site

Each blog post lives in the `posts` folder–take a look at one by opening it in the editor.

- Posts use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) (`.md`) syntax, which is more lightweight to write and read than HTML
- Each post contains **front matter** defining metdata such as the date, and title.

Templates for your site are in `src`.
