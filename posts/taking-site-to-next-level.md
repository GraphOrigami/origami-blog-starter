- Right now, your site is **live on the web**, with a real URL (a secure HTTPS address ðŸ”’) that updates as soon as you make changes to your site or app.

> ðŸ’¡ In the Glitch editor, click your project name in the top left, and in the menu that opens, select the name and type a new one. Your project will be live at the new address instantly.

- **Add a domain** to your new Glitch project! Just go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click on **Custom Domains**.
- Use the **Share** button in the editor to invite others in to edit your new Graph Origami project by typing in their email or Glitch username.

> ðŸ’¡ Make your code, or even your entire app, private to just those you invite, by [upgrading your Glitch account](https://glitch.com/pricing).

- Use a **full-powered Linux command line** to manage your new Glitch project. Go to the **Tools** menu in the Glitch editor, and click **Terminal** to peek under the hood.
