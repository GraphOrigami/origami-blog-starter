If you want to add images to your blog posts, put the images in this folder. They will end up in the `/images` area of your site.

Let's say you add an image of a cat called `cat.jpg`. After adding that image to this folder, you can include that image in a blog post with the following markdown:

```md
![A cute cat](/images/cat.jpg)
```

Replace the words "A cute cat" with some textual description of the image.
